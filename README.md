## Why?
### The family fued game did not have any way of telling who buzzed in first, so we resulted in grabbing a spoon. But that could get aggressive sometimes. 
## Mehcanical Design
The hosuing is split into four parts due to 3D printer size constraint. 

The lid is screwed together using 8 screws. 

A switch on the side turns the device on/off.

## Electrical Design
A custom PCB was designed in Eagle to assist with wiring.
